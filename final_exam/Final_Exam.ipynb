    "For your final exam, you will be looking at a dataset from FiveThirtyEight that looks at the voting record of each member of the House of Representatives ever since Donald Trump has been elected. There are eight columns: last name, state, party (Republican or Democrat), votes (the total number of votes they cast), votes_for (the total number of votes they made that agreed with Trump's position on the issue), votes_against (the total number of votes they made that disagreed with Trump's position on the issue), vote_percentage (the percentage of their votes that agreed with Trump's position) and GDP (the GDP of the state their district is in). Keep in mind that there are multiple representatives for most states. As an FYI, this data spans records from the last two Congresses (115th and 116th).\n",
