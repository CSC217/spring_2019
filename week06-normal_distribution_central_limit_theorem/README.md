# Week Six: The Normal Distribution and Central Limit Theorem

This week, we will look at continuous distributions, most importantly the Normal Distribution. We will explore the Central Limit Theorem, which is a core tenet of statistics and hypothesis testing.

## Readings

#### [Introduction to Probability and Statistics](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/algo-list/statistics/Sheldon_Ross-Introduction_to_Probability_and_Statistics-EN.pdf)  
Chapters 6 (review this week)

#### [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)  
Chapters 5, 6, 14.4 (review this week)

#### [Continuous Random Variables](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading5b.pdf)
Somewhat mathy, but a good look into how the probability density function and cumulative distribution function are found for continuous random variables

#### [Continuous Distributions](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading5c.pdf)
Info about the uniform, exponential and normal distributions.

#### [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.methodsconsultants.com/tutorial/the-central-limit-theorem-and-its-implications-for-statistical-inference/)  
I really liked this brief post on the Central Limit Theorem and why it is so important and even used their example in your lecture.

#### [Visual Vocabulary](https://gramener.github.io/visual-vocabulary-vega) *(Optional)*
Here's a really great reference sheet for understanding which visuals work best with different scenarios. May be helpful for your project.

#### [12 Things I Wish I'd Known Before Starting as a Data Scientist](https://medium.com/deliberate-data-science/12-things-i-wish-id-known-before-starting-as-a-data-scientist-45989be6300e) *(Optional)*
