    "You should always switch doors because even though the test ostensibly seems like there is a 0.5 chance of either available door having the prize, there is actually a 2/3 test of the 'other' door having the prize because of the gameshow host. He is effectively filtering the picks - for example, for the 1/3 of the time that the car will be behind Door 2, he will see that and then open Door 3. He will never open the door to reveal the car. Thus, because of that filtering effect, you should switch doors 2/3 of the time."
