# Week Nine: Hypothesis Testing II

This week, we'll continue to learn how to do hypothesis testing so we can apply it to our projects.

## Notes

If you've downloaded the class repo to your local computer, be sure to go into your folder and run 'git pull' to download any new files.

## Upcoming Dates  
**April 10**  
*Third Project Deliverable Due*

**April 24**  
*No Class*

## Lecture

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/spring_2019/blob/master/week09-hypothesis_testing_ii/Hypothesis_Testing_II.pdf) for this week's lecture.

## Classwork

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/spring_2019/blob/master/week09-hypothesis_testing_ii/Hypothesis_Testing_II_Workbook.ipynb) for this week's classwork.

## Matplotlib Visualizations

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/spring_2019/blob/master/week09-hypothesis_testing_ii/Matplotlib_Visualizations.ipynb) for our brief diversion into Matplotlib visualizations.

## Homework

For this week's homework, please apply either a z-test, one or two-sample t-test, bootstrap test, or chi-squared test to the data from your project as you see fit and submit it separately from your project update. If there isn't a natural fit for your data, do an unnatural test - make up a mean and do a t-test to see if your data is significantly different than that mean, or split your data into two at your own accord (say, western states and eastern states or developed countries and undeveloped countries) and see if there is a statistically significant difference in their means via boostrapping.

Get in touch with me if you are having issues applying this to your data! Even if it isn't a perfect fit, I want you to be comfortable applying the concepts we learn in class to your own data.

#### [Running Chi-Square Tests With Die Roll Data in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/running-chi-square-tests-in-python-with-die-roll-data-b9903817c51b)  
Good blog post about using Chi-Square methods to evaluate whether a die is fair or not, similar to what we did in class.

#### [Mistakes, We've Drawn a Few](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368) *(Optional)*

I can't officially endorse this kind of wholescale scamming but some of you may find this a good application of Python :)
