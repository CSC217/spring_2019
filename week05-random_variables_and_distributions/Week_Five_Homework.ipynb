    "* 5 Games (Win 4 Games and Lose 1 Game)\n",

    "#### 3. Typically, the way a seven game series in the NBA happens is as such: There are two home games, then three away games, then two home games. Say, in our scenario, the two teams play the first two games in Los Angeles, the next three games in New York, and the final two games in Los Angeles.\n",

    "#### The best way to go about this is to probably manually write out the scenarios in which they can win. I.e.: in order to win the series in 5 games, the Knicks can win one of two of the first two away games and all three home games OR they can win both of the first two away games and two of the three home games. Add these scenarios up to get the total probability of them winning in five games."
