# Week Three: Basic Probability I

This week, we will begin our introduction to probability by looking at set theory as well as permutations and combinations. It will be highly theoretical, but will lay the foundation for the course going forward.

Chapters 3.1 - 3.5 (review this week) and Chapters 3.6 - 3.8 and 4.1 - 4.6 (for next week)

#### [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)  
No readings.

#### [Think Bayes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf)  
Chapter 1 (for next week)

#### [Counting and Sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading1b.pdf)  
This is a helpful review of the material we covered this week.

#### [Probability: Terminology and Examples](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading2.pdf)  
Also a helpful review.

Learning about permutations and combinations may seem theoretical, but it is the foundation of learning about discrete distributions, which we will cover in a few weeks. It also has several different applications in several fields related to computer science, some of which are described here.
